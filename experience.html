									<p>Make hay while the Sun shines.</p>
									<p>
										Growing up, I learned to look for opportunities and maybe more importantly I learned to act in those moments where the
										timing was right. In the summer of 2019 with encouragement and intervention from my best friend I met with someone in 
										the data analytics industry to gain a clearer picture of the steps needed to go from where I was to a career in analytics. 
										The missing piece was my knowledge of programming and the clearest route was to pursue another degree from my Alma Mater and 
										apply for (and hopefully get) the Capstone opportunity through Sentry before graduating.

									</p>

									<p>
										With support from my partner on September 19, 2019, we sold the duplex I owned and lived in to a real estate
										developer. This secured the funds needed invest in our future and focus on my education over the coming years.
										With a lot of planning and more luck I secured the Capstone opportunity through Sentry. Now I am looking forward to post-Graduation
										and trying to secure a career as a data analyst.
